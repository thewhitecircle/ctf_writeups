We get a `xlsm` file in this one with the following content :

![](https://i.imgur.com/1W8qKgo.png)

since I opened the file in LibreOffice its showing `#NAME?` in cells for some reason otherwise in office it shows content properly, anyways in LibreOffice the actual content was visible in the formula bar above…

the interesting parts were the following :

```
=select(E1:G258)

=set.value(C1, 0)

=for("counter",0,772,2)

=set.value(B1,CHAR(BITXOR(active.cell(),24)))
```

this is basically a for loop from 0 to 772 with a step size of 2, step size means it will skip 2 items and jump forward every time, this loop iterated over the numbers present in columns E, F and G
and total numbers are 772

It was obvious to follow the script and that should show the flag but I got stuck due to how cells are numbered and how the increment in for loop but eventually i got it, the correct direction is :

```
E → F → G
next row
E → F → G
and so on
```

so from this I created a list of numbers and used a for loop with increment of step size 2 in python :

```python
values = [228,54,240,244,154,233,24,216,24,9,24,172,120,252,145,15,253,103,41,52,216,214,124,244,147,90,72,198,40,53,147,70,74,93,20,118,147,240,74,88,12,91,147,224,106,217,48,114,23,217,175,22,82,188,62,217,41,191,231,130,180,150,36,18,121,235,100,52,26,39,52,99,56,231,217,29,215,212,21,77,25,70,223,58,250,130,234,247,74,183,79,8,147,196,74,207,8,147,147,221,82,111,36,212,147,24,84,57,9,21,96,90,251,186,80,23,25,29,201,163,73,89,147,39,65,52,56,79,25,250,203,45,147,245,81,57,0,194,251,105,34,130,81,176,147,95,44,156,147,108,25,122,206,187,41,40,231,211,180,34,217,244,215,235,21,61,25,146,223,113,32,238,248,39,109,247,238,137,27,205,101,61,224,27,35,156,101,40,60,88,109,241,252,109,64,211,147,104,64,202,60,190,25,194,203,28,126,168,147,121,20,239,83,255,147,175,64,158,4,157,25,125,203,139,147,78,28,32,147,126,25,72,200,228,145,103,92,103,60,254,60,12,67,151,67,134,121,48,65,92,66,244,73,163,231,146,248,121,71,35,71,53,66,79,147,219,10,153,243,74,149,217,69,120,114,172,25,6,149,246,157,176,170,245,24,217,24,119,24,163,72,95,112,127,41,153,147,72,119,147,159,202,231,251,205,27,163,56,232,179,173,96,186,25,78,9,112,255,190,173,141,103,165,169,133,54,231,63,205,144,36,219,30,250,100,120,18,240,152,183,227,103,248,110,109,47,29,205,163,162,95,175,11,46,106,56,119,199,114,67,24,164,75,12,231,114,205,66,74,73,93,180,95,147,56,79,89,69,92,104,92,177,56,66,58,238,80,160,83,199,84,79,85,70,68,233,75,43,87,54,94,210,76,167,79,30,89,47,74,231,93,111,68,133,85,81,113,64,123,155,106,49,119,54,107,16,119,19,126,148,108,112,68,40,79,123,113,200,118,207,124,56,119,232,111,151,107,235,56,223,86,82,76,154,68,186,91,87,109,75,106,57,106,197,125,139,118,240,108,123,78,169,125,160,106,131,107,132,113,71,119,221,118,193,68,251,81,70,117,105,121,107,127,161,125,64,56,138,94,145,113,94,116,152,125,57,56,86,93,64,96,205,125,44,123,226,109,253,108,23,113,233,119,117,118,251,56,33,87,134,104,170,108,148,113,60,119,215,118,143,107,21,68,233,109,68,108,190,113,181,116,141,117,120,121,132,118,150,54,99,125,217,96,132,125,213,58,227,56,174,55,229,108,67,56,29,74,57,93,2,95,36,71,80,75,154,66,96,56,56,55,146,110,65,56,197,92,243,125,194,122,246,109,3,127,180,127,209,125,123,106,121,56,224,55,243,124,71,56,19,58,142,91,232,34,43,68,16,111,171,113,236,118,25,124,212,119,24,111,78,107,2,68,129,107,113,97,73,107,31,108,183,125,200,117,78,43,234,42,46,68,115,123,76,117,196,124,116,54,135,125,37,96,122,125,156,58,7,56,133,55,79,126,153,35,83,125,118,123,250,112,51,119,160,56,238,58,11,80,62,76,28,90,79,99,48,41,9,107,217,71,27,108,18,112,8,41,10,107,98,71,45,127,135,44,219,116,134,44,126,96,91,97,239,71,150,116,51,40,190,107,216,108,73,71,98,41,30,118,79,71,100,108,66,41,81,117,41,43,144,39,8,39,100,57,150,101,133,58,46,24,187]
